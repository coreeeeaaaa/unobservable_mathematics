# Projection-Overlap Preservation Theorems

Main results:
- `projectionOverlapExchange`: Projection-overlap exchange from structure theory
- `projection_overlap_preserve_lower_bound`: Lower bound preservation for overlap measures
  under projection operations

Mathematical foundation: σ-finiteness, subadditivity, and monotonicity properties
ensure that overlap measures satisfy minimal preservation constraints.
