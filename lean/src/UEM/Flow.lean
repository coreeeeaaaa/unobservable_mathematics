# Flow on a measurable space and measure-preserving property

Assumptions:
- (X, ùí≥) is a measurable space.
- Œº is a measure on X.

Definitions:
- Flow X: a family of measurable equivalences Œ¶ : ‚Ñù ‚Üí X ‚âÉ·µê X
  with semigroup law Œ¶ (t + s) = Œ¶ t ‚àò Œ¶ s and identity Œ¶ 0 = refl.

Main results:
- `measure_preserving_zero`: Œ¶ 0 is measure-preserving.
- `measure_preserving_add`: if each Œ¶ t is measure-preserving, then Œ¶ (t + s) is also
  measure-preserving (by composition).
